                <h1>A Glimpse Into My Life</h1>
                <strong><small> Puerto Pico 2019</small></strong>
                <p>In the image you see above a group of my friends and I went to Puerto Rico for Spring Break! At that point it had been my 3rd time in there so I acted more as a tour guide and showed them all the beautiful and funplaces in PR. In this specific photo we are at the Bacardi manufacting site in the outdoor bar area. </p>

                <p>A recent hobby that I have picked up thanks to some of my friends and family is hunting. With our families new hunting dog Yogi we have been hunting for a lot of birds. Yogi does best in water so duck hunting is what we typically do but there are times where we will go pheasant or goose hunting as well.</p>

                <p>I met the love of my life and best friend Kristian in college and we have been together for three years and counting. In May 2022 I proposed and we decided to start living on our own. We found an apartment for our first year on our own and plan on getting a house hopefully in the near future.</p>

                <p>Currently I work as a phlebotomist at CSL Plasma. I draw peoples blood from them using a phersis machine like people would for dialysis. The only difference is that we seperate and take plasma from ones blood then return ones red blood cells and an additional bit of saline to maintain blood volume.</p>
